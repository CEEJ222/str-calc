# Airbnb Investment Calculator - Project Summary

## Project Overview
Built a comprehensive React-based Airbnb investment calculator that allows real estate investors to analyze short-term rental property potential through real-time financial modeling.

## Key Features Developed

### Financial Modeling Capabilities
- Property financing calculations (loan amount, P&I payments, down payment requirements)
- Revenue projections based on average daily rate (ADR) and occupancy rates
- Comprehensive expense tracking including both traditional rental expenses and STR-specific costs
- Key investment metrics (cash flow, cash-on-cash return, cap rate, NOI)

### Expense Categories Covered

#### Traditional Property Expenses:
- Principal & Interest, property taxes, insurance, utilities
- Maintenance and capital expenditures (percentage-based calculations)
- HOA fees

#### Short-Term Rental Specific Expenses:
- Property management fees (percentage of revenue)
- Cleaning fees per turnover
- Platform fees (Airbnb/VRBO)
- Supplies, linens, internet, licenses, software

## Technical Implementation

### React Architecture:
- Functional components with hooks (useState, useEffect, useMemo)
- Real-time calculations that update as users adjust inputs
- LocalStorage integration for data persistence between sessions

### User Experience:
- Color-coded investment assessment (green/yellow/red indicators)
- Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Clean, professional interface with organized input sections
- Reset functionality and detailed expense breakdowns

## Development Journey

1. **Started with Excel template planning** - Mapped out all necessary formulas and calculations
2. **Built interactive React app** - Converted Excel logic to real-time web application
3. **Solved technical issues** - Fixed calculation updates and input handling
4. **Implemented scalable styling** - Moved from Tailwind dependency issues to clean CSS architecture
5. **Prepared for production** - Set up proper project structure for Cursor IDE migration

## Current Status

- âœ… Fully functional calculator with all core features implemented
- âœ… Clean, maintainable codebase ready for deployment
- âœ… Responsive design tested across device sizes
- âœ… Ready for migration to Cursor IDE for further development

## Business Value
Provides investors with a professional-grade tool to quickly analyze Airbnb investment opportunities, compare properties, and make data-driven investment decisions with conservative assumptions and industry-standard calculations.

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 with functional components and hooks
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with responsive design
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **State Management**: React useState and useMemo for calculations
- **Data Persistence**: LocalStorage for user input persistence
- **Development Environment**: Cursor IDE

## Key Metrics Calculated
- Monthly and Annual Cash Flow
- Cash-on-Cash Return
- Cap Rate
- Net Operating Income (NOI)
- Occupied Nights per Year
- Revenue per Occupied Night
- Detailed Expense Breakdown (monthly and annual)

## Investment Assessment Logic
- ðŸŸ¢ **Excellent**: Cash-on-cash return â‰¥ 8% AND Monthly cash flow â‰¥ $200
- ðŸŸ¡ **Moderate**: Cash-on-cash return â‰¥ 5% AND Monthly cash flow â‰¥ $0
- ðŸ”´ **Consider Alternatives**: Below moderate thresholds
